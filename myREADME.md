Run these to test locally (if dependencies are not installed, see original README on for instructions)


bundle install
bundle exec jekyll server

Afterwards, changes are reflected directly (but need to reload webpage), except those certain changes in certain files like _config, which require running the bundle exec command again. In general, if things are no properly update it, exit and re-run bundle exec.
